DFS
===

This distributed file system will probably be lazily and slowly built whenever free time permits. This project will attempt to improve upon a previous implementation [https://github.com/BenningtonCS/GFS] with better design and stability. Additionally, some features which appeared in the previous implementation may not appear in this implementation, however, some key features missing from the previous implementation, but part of the Google File System, will (hopefully) be integrated into this version.
