"""
The heartbeat is a means of detecting and tracking the servers that make up the
system. When a server joins the system, it will ping the heartbeat listener, which
adds the server to a dictionary which takes the server ip as key and the time at which
the ping was received as the value. Correctly operating servers are expected to ping
the heartbeat listener periodically, so a lapse in response over some threshold value
will mark that ip as inactive.

The server states tracked by the heartbeat module are used by the Master to delegate
chunks and files to servers and maintaining a minimum number of replications on active servers.
