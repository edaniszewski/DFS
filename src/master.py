"""
The Master class acts as the system metadata administrator and maintainer.
In addition to creating and updating metadata information, it also (or will also)
persist the data to allow for graceful recovery.

Note that the master does not handle the data associated with a file - only
the metadata associated with a file (and the chunks any file belongs to).
